we need to improve document @agents/gateway-nodes.md 
especially the intro text under # Understanding Aluvia gateway nodes
explain that any proxy client can connect to an aluiva gateway node. 
explain that our Aluvai Client connects to gateway node when routing traffic to aluva. 
tie together the concepts of gateway nodes, connection objects @agents/connections.md  , and the aluvia client.
