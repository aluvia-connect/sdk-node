## Security Best Practices

When using `@aluvia/sdk`:

1. **Never commit API keys** — use environment variables
2. **Don't log `connection.getUrl()`** — it contains credentials in gateway mode
3. **Keep dependencies updated** — run `npm audit` regularly
4. **Use the latest SDK version** — we patch security issues promptly
